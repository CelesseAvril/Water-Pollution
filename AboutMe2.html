    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>  I am just a young girl from the Caribbean who would like to see a bright and better future for the next generation. I indend to do work towards this goal by doing the little that I can, which begins here. Although it may not seem important to you I feel that it is our duty to pave the way for the next generation, even if it is something as small as this website.</p>
